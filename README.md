This is where I will be committing all of my HackPad related files.

## This is a Macropad that can help people to navigate between there Entertainment systems. For example, it will allow the person to switch from a live stream, to a movie, to music with just a few presses. The model is approximately a 1x2 top that includes 8 Cherry MX keyswitches and a rotary encoder. I built this because I like to navigate between multiple different entertainment systems constantly and found that this would be a more efficient method.

## BOM: 
1x PCB
1x rotary encoder
8x DSA keycaps
8x cherry mx switches
1x xiao rp2040
4x m3 heatset inserts
4x m3 screws
